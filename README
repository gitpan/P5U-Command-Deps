NAME
    P5U::Command::Deps - p5u plugin to scan a file or directory for Perl
    dependencies

SYNOPSIS
     $ p5u deps lib/Foo/Bar.pm
     # RUNTIME
     Foo 1.000
     constant 0
     perl 5.010
     strict 0
     utf8 0

     $ p5u deps --skipcore lib/Foo/Bar.pm
     # RUNTIME
     Foo 1.000

DESCRIPTION
    Given a list of filenames and/or directories, uses Perl::PrereqScanner
    to calculate a combined list of dependencies. If no filenames are given,
    then the current directory is assumed.

    It uses file naming conventions to attempt to classify dependencies as
    "runtime", "test" and "build".

    With the "--skipcore" option, will skip dependencies that are satisfied
    by Perl core. This requires at least one "use VERSION" line in the files
    being scanned.

    Output is in the text format shown above, but with "--format=mi" will
    attempt to output Module::Install-style requirements. With
    "--format=pretdsl" will output data in a format suitable for
    RDF::TrineX::Parser::Pretdsl.
